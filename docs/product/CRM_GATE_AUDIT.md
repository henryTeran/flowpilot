# Phase 12 CRM acceptance evidence

Canonical authority: Master Plan section 33. All four CRM phase gates remain
OPEN: CRM_SEGMENTS, REBOOKING, CUSTOMER_LIFECYCLE, AUTOMATION_EVENTS.

## 12A: exact recorded billing metric foundation

`backend/app/modules/crm/metrics.py` defines immutable, explicit scoped facts
and a pure cohort calculation. A caller must supply an entire observed cohort,
not a page of tickets. Every fact must match institute, registered customer
identity and capture instant, have a unique ticket ID, and close inside the
positive half-open observation window ending no later than capture.

Results distinguish recorded ticket frequency from physical visit frequency.
Recency is the exact capture-to-last-recorded-closing interval in microseconds;
an empty cohort has no last closing or recency. Counts per microsecond and
average baskets are exact integer ratios, avoiding float rounding. Known gross
amounts sum independently by CHF/EUR. Missing/invalid amounts suppress that
currency cohort's average rather than becoming zero. Unknown currencies count
separately and mark currency classification incomplete. Explicit zero remains
valid. No FX conversion, complete-history claim or predicted CLV is inferred.

Controlled evidence: `backend/tests/test_crm_metrics_12a.py`, 16 passing tests
on local SQLite-configured test infrastructure (the calculation itself is pure),
0.38s. Existing Starlette/httpx deprecation warning only. Tests cover empty
history, exact fractional average, mixed currencies and missing/invalid gross,
canonical amount validation, source scope/capture, duplicate identities,
half-open boundaries, offset-equivalent instants and exact microsecond windows.
No PostgreSQL, API, native UI or production acceptance is claimed by this unit.

## Remaining acceptance

- Capture retained customer-owned paid ticket cohorts from database authority,
  preserving registered customer IDs without name/phone identity inference.
  Add signed scoped routes and bounded profile reads with complete aggregate
  coverage independent of visible pages.
- Define explicit lifecycle policy and source-supported segmentation for NEW,
  ACTIVE, LOYAL, VIP, AT_RISK and DORMANT; retain unknown data where evidence is
  incomplete. No business thresholds were introduced by 12A.
- Implement source-supported CLV and customer rebooking-cycle semantics,
  distinguishing recorded gross from prediction and employee rebooking credit.
- Implement explicit birthday/communication declarations and lifecycle events
  for birthday, post-service, rebooking, inactivity, package expiry and
  subscription renewal; verify scope, provenance, repeatability and cancellation
  behavior. Actual external messages have not been sent or authorized here.
- Integrate and test native customer profile/workflows on desktop and tablet;
  close functional gates only with executable evidence. Physical-device and
  production readiness gates remain separate and open.
